# Gooligum Baseline PIC Training and Development Board

The Gooligum Baseline and Mid-Range PIC training board, previously available for sale from www.gooligum.com.au, was designed for use with the Gooligum PIC tutorials, which you can find at https://github.com/gooligumelec/PIC-tutorials.  It is also useful as a general development board for 6-, 8- and 14-pin baseline, midrange and enhanced midrange PICs.

The design files are being made available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license, which essentially means that they are free to use and share, provided that you attribute the original creator (me / Gooligum). See LICENSE.txt for details.

The files consist of the manual, Eagle schematic and board files, bill of materials in Excel format and a zip file containing the Gerber and drill CAM files.

Please note that I am not in a position to provide any support for this board.
